## 2. Basic concepts

### Accounting events

What information is important to capture, process, aggregate, and report?

1.  Purchasing merchandize or raw materials
2.  Hiring employees
3.  Contracting a loan
4.  Selling goods or services
5.  Returning goods to suppliers
6.  Paying employees

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Accounting Equation

$$Assets=Liability+Equity$$

-   Transactions (or economic events) modify assets, liabilities, and equity.
-   However, always the **accounting equation holds**.
-   This equation is the basis of **double-entry accounting.**

```{=html}
<!--
interpretations:
1) assets are financed by liabilities and equity
2) equity is the owners' residual claim on assets
-->
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Extended Accounting Equation**

$$Assets=Liability+ E_0+ Net Income- Withdrawals $$

-   Net Income: Revenues - Expenses
    -   Revenues increase Owner's Equity, whereas Expenses decrease it.
-   Owner's Equity is not static.
-   This nuanced view captures how the dynamics of business operations impact the company's financial position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Revenue recognition

It is the second pillar in accounting. It is the process of recording revenue in the financial statements. When a company records revenues, it must also record related expenses. This is the **matching principle**:

1.  Recognizing revenue when earned, regardless of when payment is received.
2.  Expenses should be matched with revenues they helped to generate in the same period, even if payment occurs later.

::: callout-note
In 2018, the FASB (ASC 606) and IFRS (IFRS 15) converged into a standard for revenue recognition. The standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when the risk and rewards of the goods or services are transferred to the customer.

### Example Silvana eTravel SA

Let's apply the accounting equation and matching principle to the following transactions:

**Transaction 1: Starting the business.**

Silvana invested \$30,000 of her own money to start the business. ​ She deposits \$30,000 in a "Silvana eTravel SA" bank account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 2: Buying an office.**

Silvana purchases an office, paying \$20,000 in cash. ​ Montly Depreciation: \$200​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 3: Buying an office supplies.**

Silvana buys office supplies, agreeing to pay \$500 within 30 days.​ These supplies will last until the end of the month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 4: Earnings of Service Revenue**

Silvana eTravel earns service revenue by providing travel services for clients. ​ She earns \$5,500 in revenues and collects this amount in cash.​ The labor cost of providing the service was \$600 and will be paid the first day of the next month.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 5: Revenue on account**

Silvana eTravel performs services for clients who do not pay immediately. ​ Silvana receives clients’ promises to pay \$3,000 within one month in return for her travel services. ​ The labor cost of the service was \$200.​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 6: Paying expenses**

During the same month, Silvana eTravel pays with cash:​

-   Wharehouse rent, \$1,100.​
-   Utilities, \$1600.​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transaction 7: Long-term debt**

Silvana borrows \$5.000 using a bank credit. The first month generates \$35 on interest expenses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Accounts classification

**Assets**

| **Current Assets**            | **Non-current Assets**             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1\. Cash and cash equivalents | 1\. Long-term investments          |
| 2\. Accounts receivable       | 2\. Property, plant, and equipment |
| 3\. Inventory                 | 3\. Intangible assets              |
| 4\. Prepaid expenses          |                                    |

```{=html}
<!--
Transactions will regularly affect the same type of assets, thus it is practical to group them into accounts.
- accounts receivable: money owed by customers
- prepaid expenses: insurance, rent, etc.
- inventory: goods available for sale
- long-term investments: investments in other companies, bonds, etc.
- property, plant, and equipment: land, buildings, machinery, etc.
- intangible assets: patents, trademarks, goodwill, etc.
-->
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Liabilities**

| **Current Liabilities**               | **Non-current Liabilities**                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1\. Accounts payable                  | 1\. Long-term debt                         |
| 2\. Accrued expenses                  | 2\. Deferred income tax                    |
| 3\. Deferred/unearned revenues        | 3\. Pension liabilities                    |
| 4\. Current portion of Long-term debt | 4\. Other long-term liabilities            |
| 5\. Taxes payable                     | 5\. Commitments and contingent liabilities |

```{=html}
<!--
payable: money owed to suppliers
accrued expenses: wages, interest, etc.
deferred/unearned revenues: money received in advance from customers
tax: income, value-added, estate tax, capital gains tax, property tax, etc. all of them due at different times
--->
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Equity**

| **Share capital**              | **Other**                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Common stock               | 1\. Retained earnings                      |
| 2\. Preferred stock            | 2\. Treasury stock                         |
| 3\. Additional paid-in capital | 3\. Accumulated other comprehensive income |

```{=html}
<!--
Share Capital: The total value of the company's shares that have been issued.
1.1 Common Stock: Equity ownership in a corporation entitles shareholders to vote and potentially receive dividends.
1.2 Preferred Stock: Shares with a higher claim on dividends and assets than common stock but typically no voting rights.
1.3 Additional Paid-in Capital: The excess over par value shareholders have paid for the company's stock.

Retained Earnings: Cumulative net income retained in the business after the distribution of dividends.

Treasury Stock: Shares that a company has repurchased from shareholders and are held in the company's treasury.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income: The total unrealized gains and losses on investments and certain foreign currency transactions are not included in net income.
-->
```
## 3. Financial Statements

### Aggregations

Each accounting event requires determining an amount affecting the respective accounts.

Some rules help us to define these amounts​.

-   **IFRS**: International Financial Reporting Standards
-   **US GAAP**: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

Consistency across time and transactions is key!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asset valuation basis

1.  **Historical Cost**: Assets are valued at their original cost.
    1.  Acquisition cost
    2.  Production cost
2.  **Amortized cost**: Assets are valued at their original cost minus accumulated depreciation.
3.  **Fair Value**: Assets are valued at their current fair value.
    1.  Market value
    2.  Net realizable value

::: callout-tip
The same asset (e.g., an office) can be valued using different methods.
What are the managerial incentives for using one method or another?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liabilities valuation

1.  **PV**: Present value of future payments.
2.  **Expected PV**
3.  **Fair Value**: Liabilities are measured at their current fair value.

Equity valuation

1.  **Historical Cost**: Retained earnings at original value.
2.  **Revaluation Reserves**: Equity can be revalued to fair value through reserves.
3.  **Fair Value through OCI**: Some equity instruments can be valued at fair value through other comprehensive income.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Financial Statements: Why?

Once we have **recorded all the transactions using the same rules**, we need to aggregate them to provide helpful information to the users of the financial statements.

Users of financial statements:

1.  Investors
2.  Creditors
3.  Employees
4.  Customers
5.  Suppliers
6.  Governments

... but why do they need financial statements? What are they looking for?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Growth: is the company growing? How?
2.  Profitability: is the company's profit satisfactory?
3.  Liquidity: can the company pay its short-term obligations?
4.  Solvency: can the company handle its long-term obligations?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users find the information to answers to these questions in the company's fillings.

-   Annual report (**10-K** )
-   Quarterly report (**10-Q**)
-   Acquisition and disposal of financial assets, changes in company management or corporate governance (**8-K**).
-   Information for shareholders to vote on issues related to the company's management (**DEF-14A: Proxy Statement**)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Core financial statements:

1.  Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet)
2.  Statement of Comprehensive Income (Income Statement)
3.  Cash Flow Statement
4.  Statement of Changes in Equity

Other sources of information:

1.  Notes to the Financial Statements
2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) ​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Statement of Financial Position

The balance sheet is a statement that lists what the organization owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and what it is worth (equity) on a *specific date*.

![](topic_1_img/img_4.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits:

- It provides insights about company situation in terms of: 
    - liquidity 
    - solvency 
    - ability to make distributions to shareholders

::: callout-warning

## Limitations

-   it does not reflect the value of the intangible assets such as human capital, or reputation.​
-   information is based on an specific date.
-   it incorporate various measurement bases: fair value, historical cost, amortized cost, etc.
:::


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Statement of Comprehensive Income

![](topic_1_img/img_3.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note

::: 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cash Flow Statement

The matching principle implies that cash inflows and outflows differ from revenues and expenses.​

Components:

1.  Cash flows from operating activities: main business activities.
2.  Cash flows from investing activities: purchase and sale of assets.
3. Cash flows from financing activities: issuance and repayment of debt and equity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Statement of Changes in Equity 

- Changes in *Equity* over a specified period.
- In general, the focus is on what elements affected the two main components of *Equity* during the period: *Common Stock* and *Retained Earnings*.


Components:

1.  Beginning balance of equity accounts
2.  **Common Stock**/**Subscribed Capital**: + capital increase; - capital decrease
3.  **Retained Earnings**: + net income; - net loss; - dividends
4.  Ending balance of equity accounts

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why could other stakeholders be interested in this?

- Creditors check if the company is reinvesting enough. Each dollar paid as a dividend is a dollar that cannot be paid later on to credits.​ 

- External investors also see if the company is increasing its capital base. It indicates that current shareholders see growth opportunities that need to be financed.​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies across Financial reports

Some examples

1.  Cash payments to reduce Trade payables will be reflected in the Balance sheet and Cash Flow Statement.​
2.  Recognizing non-current assets depreciation will be reflected in the Balance sheet and Income Statement.​
3.  Profits of the year will be reflected in the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Changes in Equity.​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Notes to the Financial Statements

They reveal important information about the company's financial position and performance that would be difficult to discern from the financial statements.

Elements:

1.  Basis of preparation: IFRS, US GAAP, etc.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies: valuation, depreciation, etc.
3.  Management' assumptions and estimates: useful life, etc.
4.  Risk characteristics: credit, liquidity, market, etc.
5.  Contingent liabilities: legal disputes, etc.
6.  Related party transactions: transactions with owners, managers, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)

It is a section of the annual report that provides management's interpretation of the company's recent performance.​

-   Issues related to current and future operations/performance
-   Favorable/unfavorable trends
-   Important events and uncertainties
-   Explanations of unusual or infrequent events
-   Price changes

It is mainly forward-looking information.​

## 4. FSA framework

Let's study a general framework for financial statement analysis (FSA).

-   How is the company growing? Type of assets, funding.​
-   Do the company needs to change our liquidity/solvency policy?​
-   Are the managers using our assets efficiently?​
-   What is driving our profits/losses?​

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Steps

1)  Macro-economic factors:
2)  Industry factors:
    1)  Industry growth
    2)  Industry structure: competition, barriers to entry, etc.
    3)  New products or technologies
3)  Company factors:
    1)  Business model
    2)  Long-term plans
    3)  Who?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Analysis and Metrics

After analyzing the previous steps, we can analyze the company's financial statements.​

1)  Comparison across time:​
    -   How is the company doing relative to previous years?​
    -   What has internally and externally changed?​
2)  Comparison within industry peers:​
    -   What explains cross-sectional differences?​
    -   Different shocks​, efficiencies, innovation, or new products.

```{=html}

1) Comparison across time:​
   - How is the company doing relative to previous years?​
   - What has internally and externally changed?​
     - Internal: new CEO, new products, new production technology.​
     - External: changes in demand, stricter financing conditions.​

2) Comparison within industry peers:​
   - What explains cross-sectional differences?​
   - Different shocks​, efficiencies, innovation, or  new products

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Areas of Financial Statement Analysis:

1.  Credit (Risk) Analysis:
    1.  Liquidity
    2.  Solvency
2.  Profitability Analysis:
    1.  Return on investment
    2.  Operating performance
    3.  Asset utilization
3.  Valuation: estimate the intrinsic value of a company (stock).

```{=html}
<!--
1. Credit (Risk) Analysis:
   1.  Liquidity: To evaluate the ability to meet short-term obligations. 
   2.  Solvency: To assess the ability to meet long-term obligations. 

2. Profitability Analysis: 
   1. Return on investment: To assess financial rewards to the suppliers of equity and debt financing. 
   2. Operating performance: To evaluate profit margins from operating activities. 
   3. Asset utilization: To assess the effectiveness and intensity of assets in generating sales.
-->
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------



**Common rules**

-   Balance sheet items: Ratios are calculated using average values.​
-   Income statement items: Ratios are calculated using year-end values.​
-   Cash flow statement items: Ratios are calculated using year-end values.​

Check the Formula Sheet for the most common ratios.

A very naive approach is to analyze the statement "as they are reported"  without adjusting them.

However, in this course, we will dig deep and learn how to measure them correctly:

-   Topic 2: Adjustments to represent real financing activity
-   Topic 3: Adjustments to represent real investing activity
-   Topic 4: Adjustments to represent real operating activity
