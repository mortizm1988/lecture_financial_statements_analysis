# 1. Cash Flow Statement

If we forget about the accruals and the matching principle, we can say that the cash flow statement is equal to the income statement.

However, as this is not the case for the vast majority of firms, we need a report informing about cash inflows and outflows.

Why? Because cash is king!

 - financial flexibility
 - solvency

---
What we want to know:
- How much cash is generated from or used in operations? 
- What expenditures are made with cash from operations? 
- How are dividends paid when confronting an operating loss? 
- How is the increase in investments financed? 
-  Why is cash lower when income increased?

## 1.1 Reporting by activity

Operating activities: cash flows from the main business of the firm

Investing activities: purchases and sales of PPE and investment in securities

Financing activities: borrowing and repaying funds with bonds and other loans, issuing and repurchasing shares, paying dividends

---
### 1.2 Constructing the Cash Flow Statement

There are two methods to construct the cash flows from operating activities:
- Direct method: cash flows from operating activities are reported directly
  - more difficult to prepare
  - more useful to investors/creditors
- Indirect method: net income is adjusted for noncash income (expense) items and accruals to yield cash flows from operations
  - easier to prepare
  - enable a reconciliation of net income and cash flows from operations

The process for the indirect method is the same in both methods

---
### 1.3 Indirect method
Let's jump to MS Excel and see how to prepare the cash flow statement using the indirect method.

#### Analyzing firms using the indirect method

**Equity Method Investments**

When a company reports that use Equity Method Accounting, we have to be aware that the firm records as income its percentage interest in the income of the investee company and records dividends received as a reduction of the investment balance

- The fraction of undistributed earnings of the investee company is non cash for the investor company
- Adjustment: subtracting from _net income_ the percentage interest in earnings of the investee company net of dividends received from the investee company

---
**Acquisition of companies with stocks**

When a company purchases another with stocks, then the consolidated balance sheet will show the assets and liabilities of the acquired company at their fair market value

- The indirect method, based on variations in balance sheet accounts, will not capture the operating cash flows.

---
**Securitization of Accounts Receivable**

Similar idea to the previous one

If Receivables are sold to a trust, then the company will report an increase in operating cash flows

But, we alredy know that is not because the company is collecting receivables more efficiently, but because it is selling/borrowing them.
