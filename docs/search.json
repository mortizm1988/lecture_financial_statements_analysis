    "text": "1. Income measurement\n1.1 Basics concepts behind accounting income\nTwo main concepts behind income measurement:\n\nEconomic income measures the net change in shareholders’ wealth during a period. Theoretically, it is equal to a period’s cash flows plus the change in the present value of expected future cash flows.\nRecurrent income is an estimate of the stable average income that a business is expected to earn over its lifetime, given the current state of its business.\n\nAlso called sustainable income or permanent income."

    "text": "4. Earnings per share\nEarnings per share (EPS) data are widely used in evaluating a company’s operating performance and profitability.\nAnalysts use this core metric to value a company and for the business press when reporting earnings announcements.\nGiven the importance of EPS, it is unsurprising that companies are motivated to manage earnings to meet or beat analysts’ EPS forecasts.\nSo, it is important to understand how EPS is calculated and how it can be manipulated.\nThe computation and reporting requirements for earnings per share under US GAAP (ASC 260) and IFRS (IAS 33) are consistent."
