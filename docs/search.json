Cash Flow Statement\nIf we forget about the accruals and the matching principle, we can say that the cash flow statement is equal to the income statement.\nHowever, as this is not the case for the vast majority of firms, we need a report informing about cash inflows and outflows.\nWhy? Because cash is king!\n\nfinancial flexibility\nsolvency"

Interpretation of cash flow statements\n2.1 Limitations\n\nLack of Extraordinary Item Disclosure: No mandate to separately reveal cash flows related to extraordinary events or terminated operations.\nInterest and Dividends Classification: Both interest and dividends received, as well as interest paid, are categorized as operating cash flows. This is at odds with views that consider interest paid as financing outflows and interest and dividends received as investment inflows.\nTax Expense Handling: Taxes are treated as operating cash flows, potentially skewing the understanding of each activity if notable tax implications are unevenly allocated. Example: a company that has a large tax refund in a given year will report a large operating cash inflow; similarly, tax from asset sales is reported as an operating cash outflow even they are part of an investing activity."
