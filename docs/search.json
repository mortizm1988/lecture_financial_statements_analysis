    "text": "2. Step 1 Projected Income Statement\nThe projected income statement is the starting point of the prospective analysis.\nStep 1.1 we need an estimation of the company’s expected sales growth rate:\n\nEasy approach: use the historical trend in sales growth rate.\nMore sophisticated approaches:\n\nexpected level of macroeconomic activity: using econometrics to link sales growth to GDP growth. If the economy is in a cyclical upturn, sales growth is expected to be higher than the historical average.\nProduct market competition: if the company is in a highly competitive industry, the company has no price-setting power, and sales growth can quickly decline.\nMultiproduct/multiservice companies."

Sensitivity Analysis\n\nWe are assuming that many dimensions of the financialsstatements will change.\nOur approach is a good starting point:\n\nto test the sheet and formula: there should not be drastic changes in the company’s financial structure\nto foresee how the company’s financial structure will look if no significant changes happen in the future\n\nvalid for mature companies,\nless for young or highly disruptive/distressed companies."
