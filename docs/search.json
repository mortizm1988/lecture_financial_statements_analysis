Step 1 Projected Income Statement\nThe projected income statement is the starting point of the prospective analysis.\nStep 1.1 we need an estimation of the company’s expected sales growth rate:\n\nEasy approach: use the historical trend in sales growth rate.\nMore sophisticated approaches:\n\nexpected level of macroeconomic activity: using econometrics to link sales growth to GDP growth. If the economy is in a cyclical upturn, sales growth is expected to be higher than the historical average.\nProduct market competition: if the company is in a highly competitive industry, the company has no price-setting power, and sales growth can quickly decline.\nMultiproduct/multiservice companies."

Theoretically, it is equal to a period’s cash flows plus the change in the present value of expected future cash flows.\nRecurrent income is an estimate of the stable average income that a business is expected to earn over its lifetime, given the current state of its business.\n\nAlso called sustainable income or permanent income.\nThe opposite is called Transitory income."
