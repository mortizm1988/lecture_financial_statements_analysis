This will allow students to identify the impacts of accounting and other corporate decisions on firm's financial statements. Part 1 of the course develops key concepts and methods for analyzing financial statements from the perspective of an external user, such as investors, creditors, suppliers, etc. Part 2 of the course takes the perspective of an internal user, such as a manager, and focuses on the use of accounting information for decision making and control purposes.
