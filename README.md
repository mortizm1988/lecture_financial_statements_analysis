## Course Description

This course introduces the main concepts related to financial statement analyses and managerial accounting. This will allow students to identify the impacts of accounting and other corporate decisions on firm's financial statements. Part 1 of the course develops key concepts and methods for analyzing financial statements from the perspective of an external user, such as investors, creditors, suppliers, etc. Part 2 of the course takes the perspective of an internal user, such as a manager, and focuses on the use of accounting information for decision making and control purposes.
